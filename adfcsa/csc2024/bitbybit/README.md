## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Initial Analysis
In this section, document your first steps in analyzing the challenge. This could include:
- Gathering any provided files.
- Looking for hints in the challenge description or files.
- Observing the challenge environment.
  
**Example:**  
- Upon opening the challenge file, I found a `readme.txt` with some instructions. It seems like the challenge is a simple web vulnerability.

### Step 2: Exploitation
Here, describe your exploitation steps in detail. This might include:
- Reverse-engineering code.
- Finding vulnerabilities in code, web apps, etc.
- Trying different methods to exploit those vulnerabilities.

**Example:**  
- I noticed that the website had an SQL injection vulnerability in the search query.
- I used a simple payload to retrieve the database structure and dumped the contents.

---

### Step 3: Flag Retrieval
This section should explain how you successfully retrieved the flag. Include commands, code, or logic used to obtain the flag.

**Example:**  
- After exploiting the SQL injection, I was able to extract a table containing a flag in the format `CTF{...}`.
