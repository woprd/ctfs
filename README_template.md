## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Initial Analysis
Describe your first steps in analyzing the challenge. This could include:
- Reviewing provided files (e.g., images, pcap, memory dumps).
- Inspecting any hints in the challenge description or files.
- Understanding the format of data or potential obfuscation methods.

**Example:**  
- The challenge provided an image file. I opened it in a hex editor and found unusual data at the beginning of the file. This could indicate hidden information, possibly from a steganography attack.

### Step 2: Investigation/Exploitation
In this section, describe how you investigated the challenge and performed exploitation, which may vary based on the challenge type:

#### For **Steganography** Challenges:
- Investigate the file for hidden data in the image, audio, or text.
- Tools such as `stegsolve`, `zsteg`, `binwalk`, or custom scripts might be used to extract hidden information.

**Example:**  
- I used `zsteg` to check for hidden data in the image. This revealed a hidden message embedded in the least significant bits of the pixels.

#### For **Digital Forensics** Challenges:
- Analyze any provided disk images, logs, or memory dumps.
- Use tools like `Autopsy`, `Volatility`, `Wireshark`, or even custom scripts to investigate artifacts, timestamps, or file signatures.

**Example:**  
- The disk image appeared to contain deleted files. Using `foremost` and `Autopsy`, I was able to recover a deleted file that contained important metadata.

#### For **Crypto** Challenges:
- Try common attacks or algorithms to break the encryption.
- Use Python libraries, `hashcat`, or `John the Ripper` to crack hashes.

**Example:**  
- The challenge used a Caesar cipher. After testing various shifts, I was able to decrypt the flag.

#### For **Web** Challenges:
- Analyze the source code or web requests (SQL injections, XSS, etc.).
- Tools like `Burp Suite` or `sqlmap` may assist in finding vulnerabilities.

**Example:**  
- I identified a SQL injection vulnerability in the login form and extracted the flag from the database.

---

### Step 3: Flag Retrieval
In this section, describe how you successfully retrieved the flag. This might include decoding messages, cracking passwords, or extracting hidden data.

**Example:**  
- After extracting hidden text from the image, I found the flag in the format `CTF{hidden_message_here}`.
